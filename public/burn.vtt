Why. are you being sued by them?

[Caio] The motorcycle?

Yeah. someone offered to buy it.
didn't I tell you?

Finally. Yeah. babe. That's good news.

72
00:05:41.166 --> 00:05:44.916
You've got a lot to do for the wedding
and that bike takes up a lot of your time.

73
00:05:45.916 --> 00:05:49.041
How was your week?
Is it too much to do all of the planning?

00:05:49.625 --> 00:05:52.458
Well. I still have
some of the decorations to figure out.

deep down are going to be wrong for you."

Let's think about this.

It's a huge step for you.

I love Caio. Why wouldn't I want that?

101
00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:57.416
You haven't slept
with many guys other than Caio.

102
00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.333
Maybe you have repressed desires.

103
00:07:00.875 --> 00:07:04.250
I'd die of boredom if I had
to sleep with the same guy for eternity.

104

You and I are different.

I don't know how you can
trust guys from dating apps.

106
00:07:08.458 --> 00:07:10.875
Girl. how's that more dangerous and risky

107
00:07:10.958 --> 00:07:13.166
than sharing your whole life with someone?

108
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.625
-Mm.
-Thank you.

It's a really cool app.

[whispering] Oh. thanks.

112
00:07:23.333 --> 00:07:27.041
This way I'll always know where you are.
and if you're safe.

113
00:07:27.125 --> 00:07:29.250
All right.
But if you get to know where I go.

114
00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:31.083
then I wanna know where you go.

115
00:07:31.166 --> 00:07:34.541
Because if one day this app shows me
that you're at a swinger's club.

that's the only way to fix it.

Uh. no. You won't need to.

that I'm selling it.

163
00:10:32.875 --> 00:10:36.791
Well. um. I started working
with the company in 2009

164
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.250
and since then
we've always worked with transparency.

My accountant brought
all of our accounting records

for Your Honor to review.

167

And for those reasons.
as Caio's accountant. I guarantee

my client had no connection to.
nor was involved in these alleged charges.

-You wanna go somewhere for lunch?
-I can't.

I'll go.

I'm okay.

00:27:56.208 --> 00:27:57.041
Thank you.

No. I'm pissed.

Who's that guy to you?

489

Always an asshole.

There should be a way to create some kind
of magnetic field around our exes.

Uh. no. I'm…

this magnetic field. like you said.

you know I'm polite.

508

I didn't want to interrupt.

509
00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:33.958
No. go back to your date. silly.
We can always talk later.

510
00:29:34.041 --> 00:29:36.958
No. no. We can talk now. This guy is dull.

He talks too much
and I just wanna get laid!

I just wanted to tell you something.

from the hearing?

and she kept staring.

then he got all tense and weird.

520
00:29:58.375 --> 00:29:59.541
So I just left.

521
00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:00.916
Yeah. that's weird.

522
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.416

and found nothing on the guy.

Nothing. Not one photo.
there's no social media. nothing.

He's a ghost.

I didn't hear you.

I'm almost home. I'll call you later.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:53.625
It's still a mess.

955
01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:58.708
Although with you by my side.

956
01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:02.791
I feel like I have a new lease on life
and things can get better again.

957
01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.083
You always say
that your life is complicated.

958
01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.291
But what is it that's so complicated
that you won't tell me?

-[thud]
-[woman] Get out of my way.

960
01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:23.041
-Don't touch me.
-[man] I'm going to call Mr. Marco.

-[tense music playing]
-[woman] I know he's in there.

962
01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.291
-Ms. Paula…
-Keep your hands off me.

963
01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:31.000
I'm going to call Mr. Marco.
but you have to wait downstairs.

964
01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.750
Wait downstairs? You're crazy.
This is my house too.

965
01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.666
Paula. what are you doing here?
Would you please leave?

966
01:04:37.583 --> 01:04:40.083
So you're the slut
who's seeing my husband?

967
01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:42.458
Husband?

968
01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:45.708
-It's not what you think.
-So you're married?

969
01:04:45.791 --> 01:04:48.416
Yes. yes. yes. We're married. of course.

970
01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.625
We're very married. You had no idea?

971
01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:51.875
[scoffs]

972
01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:54.458
Aw. what a sad little face.

973
01:04:55.041 --> 01:04:57.875
So. you believed
his sad little story. huh? [chuckles]

974
01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:01.416
The poor. disillusioned man who's hurt
and needs to be taken care of?

975
01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.458
-Shut up. Paula.
-No. don't tell me to shut up.

976
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.041
She should know the truth.

977
01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:08.666
I think she'd wanna know
how much you've hurt me.

978
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:10.333
How you destroyed my life.

979
01:05:10.416 --> 01:05:12.875
and abandoned me
just when I needed you the most.

980
01:05:12.958 --> 01:05:15.833
She should know
what an evil monster you really are.

981
01:05:17.291 --> 01:05:21.166
I mean. if he did all that to me.
to his own wife.

982
01:05:21.250 --> 01:05:23.500
I can't imagine what he would do to you.

983
01:05:24.333 --> 01:05:25.958
A meaningless hook-up.

-[Marco] Babi…
-Excuse me.

985

You had no right.

986
01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.541
-Go! Go away. Just leave.
-Babi. wait!

987
01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:35.000
-[Marco] Listen to me. I--
-Let me go.

988
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:38.125
You always seek out the truth. huh?

989
01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.833
It's all smoke and mirrors
to hide what a liar you are.

990
01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.500
Don't ever talk to me again.

991
01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:46.750
Don't come after me.

[Babi] Uh-uh.

I'm gonna take your parents to eat. okay?

-Hi.

1013
01:07:15.583 --> 01:07:16.583
Holy shit.

1014
01:07:17.375 --> 01:07:18.500
You scared us. Babi.

1015
01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:20.875
I did. huh?

1016
01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.375
What matters is that you'll be okay now.
out of danger.

1017
01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:29.000
I hope you're right.

1018
01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.833
Oh. Thi. I don't…

1019
01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:34.583
I don't remember all that much…

1020
01:07:35.916 --> 01:07:40.166

that car tried to run me off the road.

-Oh purpose?
-Uh-huh.

1022
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.666
That's bad. Who'd do that to you?

1023
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:47.000
I have no idea.

1024
01:07:47.083 --> 01:07:49.208
I'm not sure if that really happened. but…

1025
01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:51.250
it was just a gut feeling.

1026
01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:53.333
Although Caio…

1027
01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:54.958
Caio?

1028
01:07:55.041 --> 01:07:57.625
-Honestly. I have no clue what to think.
-[knocking]

I'm happy to see you're okay.

1032
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.750
There's nothing we need to talk about.

1033
01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.666
That's okay.
we don't have to talk right now.

1034
01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:16.708
I just wanted to see you.

1035
01:08:19.458 --> 01:08:20.291
You have.

1036
01:08:25.041 --> 01:08:25.875
Look…

1037
01:08:26.541 --> 01:08:28.166

1038

the flowers.

1039
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.500
but she really needs to rest.

1040
01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:35.958
I think you should leave now.

How goes it. man?

I have a favor
I need to ask you for something.

1047
01:09:05.375 --> 01:09:08.791
I'm gonna need
to check out some traffic footage.

1048
01:09:11.416 --> 01:09:13.416
I also need to put a wiretap on someone.

-Now you can get some rest. right?

And that's it.

1054
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.375
Here you go. Careful. it's hot.

1055
01:09:33.458 --> 01:09:34.625
-Thanks.
-Of course.

1056
01:09:34.708 --> 01:09:37.916
It'll be good to get back to the office
and do some work.

-I might swing by the there tomorrow.
-Don't bother.

-Thiago and I have it all covered.
-But I wanna go in.

1059
01:09:43.750 --> 01:09:45.375
There's no reason to stay here.

1060
01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:47.833
I don't want to go in a downward spiral.

1061
01:09:47.916 --> 01:09:51.666
All righty then.
I'm not gonna let that happen on my watch.

1062
01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:54.125
If I start to feel crappy.
I swear I'll come back.

-I promise.
-Yeah. all right.

I know it's probably not a good time. but…

1072
01:10:18.875 --> 01:10:21.375
I wanna explain myself
after what went down.

1073
01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:24.125
More than just explain.

1074
01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:27.750
I'd rather you actually see for yourself.

Emanuel Syndrome.

1080
01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:51.333
She also has some developmental problems.

A malformation of her intestines.
as well as a heart defect.

-Paula is Vitória's mother?
-[Marco] Yeah.

1083
01:11:06.750 --> 01:11:08.166
And you guys are married?

1084
01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.250
We were married. Four years.

1085
01:11:12.416 --> 01:11:15.458
At first. we were happy together.

1086

[inhales deeply]

1087

But even before she-- she got pregnant.

1088
01:11:20.125 --> 01:11:22.833
I'd already been worried
about Paula's mental health.

[tense music playing]

1090

After she got pregnant. it just got worse.

1091
01:11:33.083 --> 01:11:34.875
I tried everything.

1092
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.708
I took her to doctors. psychiatrists. but…

1093
01:11:38.791 --> 01:11:41.291
she'd quit her treatment
as soon as she started it.

1094
01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:47.833
Then Vitória was born.
and we learned about her disability.

1095
01:11:48.750 --> 01:11:52.333
[Paula] I thought that getting married
and becoming a mother

1096
01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:54.666
would give me a purpose.

been losing myself little by little.

[Marcos] Until one night
when she came to the hospital…

1108
01:12:29.875 --> 01:12:33.291

01:12:45.416 --> 01:12:49.125
I had to file a restraining order
to keep Vitória safe. away from Paula.

1115
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.083
That was the hardest decision of my life.

That's why that day on the pier
I had to leave. to go handle that.

1118
01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.166
They called me from the hospital
saying that she was trying to get at her.

After all that.

I swore I'd never
get involved with anyone ever again.

But to be honest…

I have utterly

Then I can finally live my life again.

Well then.
I think we should wait then. right?

It was stolen.
This gets more and more suspicious.

Maybe it's a random coincidence.
I'm not sure.

What's going on with the laptop
we took from Caio?

1154
01:15:11.416 --> 01:15:13.500
Did you give it to the lawyers?
What's the verdict?

1155
01:15:13.583 --> 01:15:15.375
Yeah. I left the laptop with them.

but this will take some time.
Babi. you know that. right?

1157

we should take it to Marco's office.

But Marco is the judge. Babi.

The one on the case. It's a bad idea.

Maybe. But he's turning out
to be a really great person.
